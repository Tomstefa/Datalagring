				"duration": "15 minutes",
				"explanation": "<p>Declare your app by creating a structure that conforms to the App protocol and add one or more scenes to it. You can use built-in scenes, like WindowGroup, or you can compose custom scenes that conform to the Scene protocol. Scenes contain the view hierarchies that define the user interface of your app, and have a life cycle that the system manages.</p>"

				"duration": "15 minutes",
				"explanation": "<p>Views and controls are the visual building blocks of your app's user interface. Use them to present your app's content onscreen. Views represent text, images, shapes, custom drawings, and compositions of any and all of these together. Controls enable user interaction with consistent APIs that adapt to their platform and context. Combine views using containers that specify their visual relationships and hierarchy. Use methods called modifiers to customize the display, behavior, and interactivity of built-in views and those you create for your app.</p>"

				"video": "SwiftUI%20trimmed.mp4",
				"duration": "15 minutes",
				"explanation": "<p>Use stacks and lists to lay out the views of your user interface. You can combine static views with views that are dynamically generated from collections of data. All container views update and adjust the positions of their children in response to changes in content or interface dimensions.</p>"

				"duration": "15 minutes",
				"explanation": "<p>Integrate SwiftUI with your app's existing content using:</p><ul><li><p>Hosting controllers to add AppKit, UIKit, or WatchKit views and view controllers to your SwiftUI interfaces. A hosting controller wraps the designated view or view controller and facilitates communication between the wrapped object and your SwiftUI views.</p></li><li><p>Representable objects to add SwiftUI views into your existing AppKit, UIKit, or WatchKit interfaces. A representable object wraps a set of SwiftUI views in a form that you can then add to your storyboard-based app.</p></li></ul>"

				"duration": "15 minutes",
				"explanation": "<p>SwiftUI offers a declarative approach to user interface design. As you compose a hierarchy of views, you also indicate data dependencies for the views. When the data changes, either due to an external event or because of an action taken by the user, SwiftUI automatically updates the affected parts of the interface. As a result, the framework automatically performs most of the work traditionally done by view controllers.</p><p>The framework provides tools, like state variables and bindings, for connecting your app's data to the user interface. These tools help you maintain a single source of truth for every piece of data in your app, in part by reducing the amount of glue logic you write.</p>"
